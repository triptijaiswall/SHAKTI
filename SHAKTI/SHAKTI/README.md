Women: A Century of Change.
Women are the future fundamental of every country. We focus on strengthening the measures for the safety of women in the country and instill a greater sense of security in them through speedy and effective administration of justice in a holistic manner and by providing a safer environment for women. We provide a platform for women to report crimes against them and to seek mental and physical help. We promise every woman to make them feel safer and protected.



# SERVICES

Navigation through safe routes
SOS Alarm
Safety zone identification
Guardian emergency reach-out

Many women are unaware of their fundamental rights, so to let them know about their basic rights we have a "Rights" column. Where they can have enough knowledge about it. If a woman feels unsafe or wants to share something, she can have a one-to-one conversation with the coordinator of the site using our chat box function. We don't reveal victim's identity in public.

'Women were incredible, Women are incredible, and Women will always be incredible'
